# This file contains all "visible" strings that aren't related to internal systems, logging or command arguments.
# Uncomment and change them at your own responsibility. Leave those you don't need commented out, it will guarantee that you get the default.
# General tips:
# \n forces a newline, formatting does not carry over through them.
# Long lines in tooltip strings are a bad idea.
# Make sure that dynamic strings have ALL their %s or %d arguments. If they have any more or less, things WILL break.
# Do NOT add any additional strings to this list, everything you need is here. Unknown or immutable strings will be rejected.
